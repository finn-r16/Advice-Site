                            Another thing, communicate with teachers and try to build strong relationships with them. Even with some of my most difficult teachers, sending them an email has never failed. </p>

Someone is probably wondering the same thing, so take the risk and be proactive).  Signing up for study halls isn't a cardinal sin - they can be good opportunities to get ahead of work for busy students and athletes, or just time to take a break during school.  Upperclassmen are lit.

                        <p> Honors classes aren’t as challenging as you think! I feel like middle school teachers made honors classes seem like these very scary and much higher level classes and that discouraged a lot of people from taking them. The intensity of honors classes all depend on the teacher, the subject, and your overall interest in the subject. In my experience the more I like a subject the more work I am willing to put into it. So if there is a subject you really don’t like and have trouble focusing during you don’t have to take an honors level! For example, I really don’t like history it is very boring to me and I usually avoid studying for the tests until the last minute because the subjects never interest me. So I didn’t take honors history and I instead took honors level courses and eventually AP for courses that did actually interest me. That being said though honors are not everything. It is better to succeed  in an CP class than to struggle in an honors class. I know it is early but I also know some are already thinking about what to do to look good for colleges and my best advice is to just focus on yourself. Don’t take honors or AP classes that you know you will heavily struggle with just to be able to say you took them. Because surprise surprise colleges would rather see As and Bs in CP classes than Cs and below in honor classes!! And if you are unsure if you can handle the honors course start with CP, if you find it is too easy you can always move up!

Who the smartest person in your class was isn’t going to matter in the future, but how much work you were putting into the class will. </p>

                            <p>One thing I wish I knew before starting at FHS, is comparing yourself to other students is a recipe for failure.  Take classes that interest you and you are comfortable with, it’s always great to take a challenging class but keeping your mental health in mind is very important when it comes to school.  You arn’t the same as any student, be happy for each other’s successes because everyone works at there own pace.</p>

Really talk with your advisory + teacher - you'll be with them for 4 years and it can be a lot of fun.  Do Track & Field if you don't have a Spring Sport that you like: it's super laid back and definitely beginner friendly.  These 4 years should be FUN! Or at least memorable.

If you don’t feel comfortable asking the teacher especially in the beginning ask someone who is doing well in your class, an upperclassman whos taken the course, or go to the tutoring center. If the course is really confusing make a list of questions you had after doing the homework or being in class and bring them to the teacher during AFT or before class so you can get a little bit of extra help. If the way the teacher is explaining it is still stumping you ask another teacher who teaches the same subject! </p>

                            <p>Although I didn’t get it my freshman year, fallfest, more importantly the last day of fallfest has become a really fun tradition to me. Dressing up on class colors and playing games, decorating the halls, and getting to become closer with your class are all parts of this school event.</p>

                              <p>Film fest has always been my favorite. It is a spring event where students from Falmouth and nearby schools create short films that are played in the theater. After all the films are played the audience votes on what film gets what award and there is an award ceremony where winners receive anchor trophies. It is a very fun experience for the audience and the creators of the films and I really hope we have it again this spring. </p>

                            <p>I remember walking into school, freshman year, sometime before midterms and I don’t remember much but I do remember just resting my head on the table and crying in the middle of the downstairs commons amongst my friends. After that day I didn’t attend school for the rest of the year because I was hospitalized for suicidal possibility. After that I didn’t attend school until the following year. at that point I had realized I overdid myself stressing about how much work I was doing, If I was doing enough, to much. Stressing about my grades, my social life. What I’m trying to get at here is that  sometimes you just need to not overthink things, always reach out to a teacher, a friend, family, if needed. That’s what I was lacking, I was always a “I can do it myself” kind of guy, but look where that lead me. If you struggle with mental health issues like I do, then please reach out, it is a real struggle if you go alone.</p>

                            <p>Lunch is always my favorite part of the day! The hot specials are pretty much always S tier (get the chilli, pasta, and BLT's they're so good), and the lunch ladies are super nice. Eating outside is great in the fall/spring/summer, since it's comfortable and you can take off your mask.  Pick up your trash though - respect the custodial staff and your school.</p>
