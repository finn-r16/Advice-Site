      <p>
        Covid-19 changed the high school experince for the class of 2022. As of this year, our class is the only one in the school that has ever experinced what FHS was like before the pandemic. This website is meant to serve as a honest collection of memories and experinces of a class like no other. My hope is that our stories depict what it was like to be in highschool durring a pandemic as well as restore school traditions that have been exhstighished by lockdowns and mandates.
      <p>
        Futhermore, this site is a guide for incoming FHS students who dont know what to expect. We have done all 4 years of this so we know a thing or two by now.
