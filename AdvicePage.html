                        Don’t stress your self out about grades and test scores
                        so much. They matter of course, but putting unneeded
                        pressure on yourself will only make it worse. As long as
                        you try your best, there is literally nothing else you
                        can do. Another thing, communicate with teachers and try
                        to build strong relationships with them. Even with some
                        of my most difficult teachers, sending them an email has
                        never failed.

                        Honors classes aren’t as challenging as you think! I
                        feel like middle school teachers made honors classes
                        seem like these very scary and much higher level classes
                        and that discouraged a lot of people from taking them.
                        The intensity of honors classes all depend on the
                        teacher, the subject, and your overall interest in the
                        subject. In my experience the more I like a subject the
                        more work I am willing to put into it. So if there is a
                        subject you really don’t like and have trouble focusing
                        during you don’t have to take an honors level! For
                        example, I really don’t like history it is very boring
                        to me and I usually avoid studying for the tests until
                        the last minute because the subjects never interest me.
                        So I didn’t take honors history and I instead took
                        honors level courses and eventually AP for courses that
                        did actually interest me. That being said though honors
                        are not everything. It is better to succeed in an CP
                        class than to struggle in an honors class. I know it is
                        early but I also know some are already thinking about
                        what to do to look good for colleges and my best advice
                        is to just focus on yourself. Don’t take honors or AP
                        classes that you know you will heavily struggle with
                        just to be able to say you took them. Because surprise
                        surprise colleges would rather see As and Bs in CP
                        classes than Cs and below in honor classes!! And if you
                        are unsure if you can handle the honors course start
                        with CP, if you find it is too easy you can always move
                        up!

                        school ends in June. Since I moved from a school that

                        other peoples, but try to just focus on yourself, if you
                        are understanding the class or just trying your hardest.
                        Who the smartest person in your class was isn’t going to
                        matter in the future, but how much work you were putting
                        into the class will.

                        One thing I wish I knew before starting at FHS, is
                        comparing yourself to other students is a recipe for
                        failure. Take classes that interest you and you are
                        comfortable with, it’s always great to take a
                        challenging class but keeping your mental health in mind
                        is very important when it comes to school. You arn’t the
                        same as any student, be happy for each other’s successes
                        because everyone works at there own pace.

                        While it's good to try out new things, don't force
                        yourself just for the sake of "doing". Never calculate
                        your GPA: it's just going to trigger a chain reaction of
                        anxiety and stress, especially if you do it during class
                        :) Find your way to get organized - a good system will
                        be a lifesaver throughout highschool. Really talk with
                        your advisory + teacher - you'll be with them for 4
                        years and it can be a lot of fun. Do Track & Field if
                        you don't have a Spring Sport that you like: it's super
                        laid back and definitely beginner friendly. These 4
                        years should be FUN! Or at least memorable. Or maybe
                        just tolerable.

                        or before class so you can get a little bit of extra

                        Friend groups change and its ok! I made alot of friends
                        throughout high school but it was really hard when I
                        stopped being close with some of them. Learning to move
                        on is honestly better then trying to maintain those
                        friendships, especially when they are people who like to
                        start drama. I became friends with so many people I
                        never thought I would and also reconnected with friends
                        from middle school and my freshman/sophomore year.

                        it. Self advocacy can be really difficult, but it’s

                        This school is incredibly academically competitive and
                        can create toxic environments. Don't let it get to you

                        everyone makes it seem. the grades you get and the
                        college you go to matters way less than everyone makes

                        to a college you like no matter the level of prestige or
                        how selective it is. Don't get sucked into the pressure
                        cooker of academic competition.

                        Don't worry about it. Everything is probably going to
                        work out. This will be important memories but also if it

                        I only went through 2 years ;) but the best advice I
                        have is don’t procrastinate major projects. Teachers are
                        slowly shifting away from tests and exams in favor of
                        seminars and projects, and unlike tests where studying
                        at the last minute is a viable option (not the best
                        option, but viable), projects require way more time and
                        effort to complete.

                        Most teachers are super understanding if you are going
                        though a tough time. If you communicate with them and

                        school related, they will be accommodating.

                        grades don’t matter as much as you think they do. i
                        promise. sleep is always more important than an A.
                        ALWAYS talk to your teachers, they will work with you to
                        understand what you are going through. They are there to
                        help.

                        Although I didn’t get it my freshman year, fallfest,
                        more importantly the last day of fallfest has become a
                        really fun tradition to me. Dressing up on class colors
                        and playing games, decorating the halls, and getting to
                        become closer with your class are all parts of this
                        school event.

                        Some people would disagree with me and say they’re lame,
                        but school dances, like homecoming, can be so much fun
                        if you go with a group of friends. Football games and
                        other sports events are also awesome to go to.

                        Spirit week is always fun for the whole school to
                        connect and enjoy being in high school while forgetting
                        some of the everyday stresses of class. I think it’s fun
                        seeing all the students so excited to represent their
                        grade.

                        classes get united.

                        Spirit week - 5 differently themed days such as
                        tropical/Hawaiian, old school, grade color, etc. Really
                        fun to see the school come together in such a simple way
                        even when I wear the wrong color somehow.

                        Film fest has always been my favorite. It is a spring
                        event where students from Falmouth and nearby schools
                        create short films that are played in the theater. After
                        all the films are played the audience votes on what film
                        gets what award and there is an award ceremony where
                        winners receive anchor trophies. It is a very fun
                        experience for the audience and the creators of the
                        films and I really hope we have it again this spring.

                        Going to the drama festival Senior year. We put on a one
                        act show with 5 minutes to get the set on stage, 40
                        minutes to preform, and then take the set down. We got
                        to compete our show against a bunch of other schools and
                        watch their performances too. Upperclassmen generally
                        get the lead roles but you can still understudy, help
                        out with the set, and better your chances of getting a
                        role next year. Also its just fun to meet theater kids
                        from other schools and hangout with your friends. If you
                        like theater I highly recommend going festival, it was
                        an unforgettable experience.

                        a great place to relax during the school day. Try out
                        art classes, don’t just take one to get the credit, it
                        might actually be fun to try something new.

                        The art programs are one of the places that I feel most
                        like myself. Being able to be in a creative environment,
                        taking time to put your right brain on hold and letting
                        more of your left do the work, and student and teacher
                        friendships are some of the best parts of the art
                        programs :) highly recommend taking ceramics when you

                        in the winter, and do a musical in the spring. Everyone
                        in the theater department is so nice and the community
                        and atmosphere is really fun. If you are thinking about

                        is also a good way to check out the theater scene

                        during study halls and lunches, the social aspect of
                        high school is very fun!

                        I remember walking into school, freshman year, sometime
                        before midterms and I don’t remember much but I do
                        remember just resting my head on the table and crying in
                        the middle of the downstairs commons amongst my friends.
                        After that day I didn’t attend school for the rest of
                        the year because I was hospitalized for suicidal
                        possibility. After that I didn’t attend school until the
                        following year. at that point I had realized I overdid
                        myself stressing about how much work I was doing, If I
                        was doing enough, to much. Stressing about my grades, my
                        social life. What I’m trying to get at here is that
                        sometimes you just need to not overthink things, always
                        reach out to a teacher, a friend, family, if needed.
                        That’s what I was lacking, I was always a “I can do it
                        myself” kind of guy, but look where that lead me. If you
                        struggle with mental health issues like I do, then
                        please reach out, it is a real struggle if you go alone.

                        Lunch is always my favorite part of the day! The hot
                        specials are pretty much always S tier (get the chilli,
                        pasta, and BLT's they're so good), and the lunch ladies
                        are super nice. Eating outside is great in the
                        fall/spring/summer, since it's comfortable and you can
                        take off your mask. Pick up your trash though - respect
                        the custodial staff and your school.
