      <p>
    I was inspired to start this project watching my little brother transition into high school at the height of the pandemic. Seeing how many questions he had for me like, "will my friend group change?", "how many honors or AP classes are right for me?", “How has covid changed the high school experience”. It reminded me of how my friends and I felt when we were at that age. My hope is that all of the seniors can help the incoming freshmen make the big jump just like we would help our own siblings.
      <p> <br>
    I built this website during a lockdown, so covid-19 had a big impact on its creation. The pandemic completely altered the high school experience for the class of 2022. As of this year, our class is the only one in the school that has ever experienced what FHS was like before the pandemic. We experienced a lot of the traditions that were lost because of covid. Seniors, please use this site to share your story and give advice to the classes that will soon fill our shoes.
