      <p>
        I was inspired to start this project watching my little brother transition into high school. Seeing how many questions he had for me like, "Will my friend group change?", "How many honors and AP classes are right for me?", â€œHow do I manage my schedule? ''. It reminded me of how my friends and I felt when we were at that age and how frightening it all seemed. I wanted to build this website so that seniors could share their highschool advice and help the incoming freshmen make the big jump just like we would help our own siblings.

      The pandemic also played a big part in the creation of this website. In 2020 the 8th grade class graduated middle school during a lockdown and a lot of them didn't have any friends or family at FHS who they could talk to. Not knowing how long the pandemic would last or if there would be another lockdown, I wanted them to have a resource for advice from high school students.
      <br><br>
      Furthemore as of this year, our senior class is the only one in the school that has ever experienced what FHS was like before the pandemic. As underclassmen we got to participate in a lot of the traditions and school spirit that was lost due to covid. Sharing what it was like before the pandemic is a step towards restoring the school culture that made high school fun and memorable.
