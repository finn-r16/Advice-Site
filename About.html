        I was inspired to start this project watching my little brother transition into high school at the height of the pandemic. Seeing how many questions he had for me like, "Will my friend group change?", "How many honors and AP classes are right for me?", “How has covid affected the high school experience?”. It reminded me of how my friends and I felt when we were at that age. It also got me thinking about all the 8th graders who were in lockdown and didn't have anyone to answer their questions. At a time when we were all so disconnected, I knew a website would be the best way for senior’s to share advice with whoever needs it. My hope is that with this site, all of us seniors can help the incoming freshmen make the big jump just like we would help our own siblings.

      The pandemic completely altered the high school experience for the class of 2022 and I wanted to take that into account while building this website. As of this year, our class is the only one in the school that has ever experienced what FHS was like before the pandemic. As underclassmen we got to participate in a lot of the traditions and school spirit that was lost due to covid. Sharing what it was like before the pandemic is a step towards restoring the school culture that maskmandates, lockdowns, cohorts, social distancing, etc took from us. Seniors, please use this site to not only give advice, but to share your story and bridge our class with the ones that will soon fill our shoes with.
